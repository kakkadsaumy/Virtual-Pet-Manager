# Virtual-Pet-Manager
The game is a virtual pet simulation where the player creates and cares for a digital animal. The primary objective is to keep the pet's core statistics - Happiness, Energy, and Hunger - at optimal levels to prevent it from "passing away." The simulation progresses in daily cycles, and the game features a dedicated screen for pet creation and a main game screen for interaction and monitoring. The current pet design utilizes dynamic drawing functions within Pygame to render unique visuals for each species, adapting to the screen resolution and the pet's size attribute. This focus on procedural drawing allows the pet's appearance, including its eyes and mouth, to be manipulated directly by the game's core statistics, providing immediate emotional feedback to the player. The code effectively manages these complex graphical updates across different game states from the small, static preview on the creation screen to the large, animated display during active gameplay.
